Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

* sales
* menu
* members
